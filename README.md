# Hi, I'm Vibhor

This page is supposed meant to be documentation on me. However, this is a work in progress and perhaps will always be as I try to discover new things about myself every day.

Two reasons for it to exist

1. The creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values.
2. Hopefully this will help you understand me better and help us work together.

This document is NOT meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other personally

## My Job(s)
### Service to Trantor

### Service to my Customers

### Service to my Team

## My Availability

**TLDR;** Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let‚Äôs talk.

Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I‚Äôd love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, stop me in the hall, shoot me a message, we don‚Äôt need to wait for a next scheduled 1:1.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don‚Äôt feel like you need to ask first.

Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I‚Äôll very likely be able to move something around.

## My assumptions

**You‚Äôre very good at your job**. You wouldn‚Äôt be here if you weren‚Äôt. If it feels like I‚Äôm questioning you it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board and rubber duck; to help you clarify your thoughts and ideas.

**I‚Äôm not good at your job**. You know best. I‚Äôll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas, but I won‚Äôt override you.

**You‚Äôll let me know if you can‚Äôt do your job**. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you‚Äôre set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm letting you down.

**You feel safe debating with me**. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I‚Äôm disagreeing I‚Äôm most likely just playing devil‚Äôs advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

### How can I help you?

**Provide context**. Most of my day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, and product lines. I‚Äôll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

**Provide an outside(ish) perspective**. I won‚Äôt be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

**Cheer**. I will celebrate your successes. If you're not a person who self-promotes, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share the things which make you proud, and I'll cheer/share appropriately.

**Firefight**. If my favourite opening line is "I could use a hand with...", my second favourite is "I screwed up: ...". A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.

**Other**. Please let me know how else I can help. 

## How can you help me?

**Do amazing work**. This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

**Disagree with me**. The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos . I‚Äôll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you‚Äôll challenge mine.

**Tell me when I screw up**. This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don‚Äôt notice. I need to know, or I‚Äôll likely do it again.

**Communicate**. One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know, and I‚Äôll fill you in or go find out.

**Bring your friends**. We‚Äôre growing the team, and you know who you want to work with.


## Your development

_‚ÄúNo one hands you personal growth here; but it's there for the taking. It's being able to try hard things; that you might not succeed at every time. It's seeing the practices of the talented people around you; practices that you're free to steal. Or it's the advice that others will give to you; advice that you didn't always ask for but is usually a good idea to take.‚Äù_ - Steven Noble

Your career is yours. You know best how you‚Äôd like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.

I‚Äôll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it‚Äôll be up to you to seize them. Let‚Äôs work together on this.

At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.

## Feedback
Feedback is critical to both of our successes. Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:

**Safety** - Unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback. Should be high

**Effort** - The amount of work in order to give feedback. Should be low

**Benefit** - How likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? Should be high

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

### When/how?
I don‚Äôt believe in storing feedback and then scheduling a time to provide it. If I have feedback to give you I‚Äôll work to provide it as soon as possible, in the moment if I can. It‚Äôs unlikely it‚Äôll start with ‚ÄúI have some feedback to give you‚Äù.

### More specific?
If you‚Äôd like specific feedback on something let me know! I‚Äôm happy to provide an outside perspective.

### What should you do with feedback?
Consider it. Like everything else, please think about each piece critically and decide whether to act on it or not.

## One on Ones

There‚Äôs a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my direct reports. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee in the cafe, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.

Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We‚Äôll start with 45 minutes bi-weekly and then adjust from there.

The best 1:1s I‚Äôve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you‚Äôd like to discuss. I‚Äôd love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time. 

## What I value

### Ownership
Think long term and don‚Äôt sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. Act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just your own team. Never saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my job". 

### Craftsmanship and Excellence
Have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Continually raise the bar and drive your teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed, so they stay fixed.

### Work Ethics
Work ethics are a set of moral principles that you use while doing a job. It is important to me that we do our jobs with honesty and repay the customer with hard work and dedication.

## My interests

Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets :smiley:

* **Coffee**. I love coffee. I love talking about coffee. I love trying new coffee. I love making coffee. I love drinking coffee. I love coffee. I'm always looking for new coffee shops to try, and new beans to try at home. I'm also always happy to talk about coffee, so if you have a favourite coffee shop or bean, let me know!
* **Tennis**. I love playing tennis, and strive towards getting better at it. I started playing very late in life, so I'm not very good at it, but I'm always looking for people to play with. If you're interested in playing, let me know!
* **Riding my motorcycle**. I have an RE Super Meteor 650. It gives me great joy while riding it.

## Lastly,

This document is new and still a wip. I‚Äôd love your feedback.

Did you find the time you spent reading this valuable?

Was something critical missing?

Were there slides included that you didn‚Äôt find useful

If you see me not living up to anything included please let me know. It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôve changed my mind (üëç). More likely I‚Äôm dropping the ball (üëé). Either way I‚Äôd like to know.
